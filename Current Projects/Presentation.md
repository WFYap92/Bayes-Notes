Why will you be successful in this Role?
- In place of giving you a salesperson's answer and letting me go sell myself.
- Let me give you something accurate, I can't predict the future. I know this is not what you expect or maybe what you want.
- To quote Neil deGrasse Tyson, "...the universe is in us."
- I am made out of the same things as the universe, what am I capable of I will never know until more time has passed. Until I get the training and pushed myself. I can't answer you that.
- But as with more training only then I can give tell you if I would or would not succeed.
